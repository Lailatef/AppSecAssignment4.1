What I fixed I by delete -> intent.type = "text/giftcards_browse"
                        -> intent.data = Uri.parse("https://appsecclass.report/api/index")
and fixed this  var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW) to this -> val intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
it can make the user buy giftcard fast instead to bring the user to the giftcard page
